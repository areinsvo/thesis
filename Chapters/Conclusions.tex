In this dissertation, a search for gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking in events with two photons and missing transverse momentum was described. The analysis was performed with data taken with the CMS detector in 2016, but suggestions to improve the background estimation methods for the analysis of the 2017 data were also explored. Results were interpreted in the context of two simplified models, one assuming squark pair production and the other assuming gluino pair production.  No evidence for gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) was observed, and limits were placed on the masses of supersymmetric particles. Work is also ongoing to combine this analysis with other analyses targeting photon final states, in order to set limits on more comprehensive GMSB models.
