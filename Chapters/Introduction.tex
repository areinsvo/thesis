\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest machine in the world and an incredible feat of engineering and science. This machine is used to study elementary particles and their interactions. Proton At the LHC, proton-proton collisions occur at center-of-mass energies up to 13 TeV. 

The Standard Model of particle physics describes fundamental particles and their interactions to an incredible level of precision. This is described in more detail in  Chapter XX. 

The CMS detector and various subsystems will be described in Chapter~\ref{chap:Detector}. Finally, Chapter XX will include a discussion of the results of this analysis and suggestions for future work.
