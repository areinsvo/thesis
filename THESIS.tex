  \begin{acknowledge}

There are many people whose guidance and support were instrumental in making this a reality. Thank you to my advisor, Mike Hildreth, for your patience and encouragement over the last few years. Thank you for always being willing to sit down with me to talk through whatever issue I was facing in the analysis. Thank you to the rest of my analysis group, both current and previous members, who contributed code, plots, and ideas to pull all of this together: Andrew Askew, Lisa Paspalaki, Tom McCauley, Marc Weinberg, Iasonas Topsis Giotis, and Arka Santra. 

I also need acknowledge my committee members---Antonio Delgado, Colin Jessop, and Sylwia Ptasinska---for their guidance and suggestions, and Shari Herman, for all of the work she does to keep the department running and to look out for us graduate students. Thank you to Richard and Peggy Notebaert, whose generous gift to the university to found the Richard and Peggy Notebaert Premier Fellowship gave me the freedom to pursue this research. 

Thank you to my classmates---Ek Adhikari, Rodolfo Capdevilla, Laura Collins, Ali Deatsch, Nabarun Dev, James Kelly, Liz Louden, Anthony Ruth and honorary member Patrick Louden---for an amazing five years. We've come a long way since sitting in awkward silence in the first year office working alone on prelim prep problems. 

Many thanks need to go to my friends and family who have been supportive in so many ways. Thank you to my dad, for encouraging me to apply to Notre Dame in the first place. I am very glad I listened to you. I always appreciate your genuine interest and curiosity when I tell you about my research. Thank you to my mom, for your constant love and encouragement. You do so many things for our family that often go unacknowledged. To my siblings, thank you for always keeping me humble. 

Finally, thank you to my husband, Matt. Thank you for finding the balance between sympathetically listening to my complaints and ordering me to stop procrastinating and get to work. Thank you for all of your suggested edits and your patience and insights when I constantly asked your opinion on everything from how a plot looked to the basic principles of the analysis. This would not have been possible without you. I am excited for the adventures ahead of us.
